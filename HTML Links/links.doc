The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

<a href="url">link text</a>

By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. 
To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:
    _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
    _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
    _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
    _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
